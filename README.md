Project Overview

This project is a Java console application that implements the registration and login functionality required for PROG5121 Part 1. The application allows a user to register using a username, password and South African cell phone number, and then log in using the registered details.

Features

	•	Username validation
	•	Password complexity validation
	•	South African cell phone number validation using a regular expression
	•	User registration
	•	User login authentication
	•	First name and last name welcome message
	•	JUnit unit testing for valid and invalid inputs

Technologies Used

	•	Java
	•	Apache Maven
	•	NetBeans
	•	JUnit
	•	Git and GitHub

Project Structure

	•	Main.java - Handles user input and runs the console application.
	•	Login.java - Contains the registration, validation and login logic.
	•	LoginTest.java - Contains the JUnit tests for Part 1 functionality.

How to Run

	1.	Open the Maven project in NetBeans.
	2.	Run Main.java.
	3.	Follow the registration and login prompts in the console.

Testing

Unit tests are contained in LoginTest.java. The tests check valid and invalid usernames, passwords and cell phone numbers, as well as successful and failed login functionality and the required system messages.
Regex Reference

The South African cell phone regular expression used in this project is:
^\\+27\\d{10}$
^\\+2The pattern was developed using the South African numbering requirements published by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). ICASA identifies South African telephone numbers as 10-digit national numbers, while the South African numbering plan uses country code +27 for international format. The national leading 0 is removed when the country code is used, resulting in +27 followed by nine digits.
